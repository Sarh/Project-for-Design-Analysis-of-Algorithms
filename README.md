Desired Program Behavior

1 - user prompted to enter a value for N as input

2 - program generates N integers which are either 

	a) sorted in decreasing order

	b) all integers are picked randomly w/ uniform distribution from range [0, MAX_RANGE], MAX_RANGE = 10,000

... a) should ask an input X and set the first element of the array to N-X, the second to N-2X, etc

3- the program sorts the N integers using QuickSort and Randomized QuickSort and outputs a file, "output.txt" w/ original and sorted values

To Use: 

cd Release

./quickSort


Follow the menu instructions.
